# What is Eagle?
EAGLE is a scriptable electronic design automation (EDA) application with schematic capture, printed circuit board (PCB) layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) features. EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor

# Schematic design and the use of it 
A schematic is defined as a picture that shows something in a simple way, using symbols. A schematic diagram is a picture that represents the components of a process, device, or other object using abstract, often standardized symbols and lines.



# PCB design and use of it
A printed circuit board (PCB) is a structure for assembling electronic components and their connections into a unified circuit that allows electrical current to pass between components. The PCB baseboard is typically made of a rigid nonconductive material, although it can also be built on a flexible base or on a base made up of both rigid and flexible materials. Electronic components such as diodes, inductors and transistors attach to the circuit board, and traces (electrical conduits) connect components.
