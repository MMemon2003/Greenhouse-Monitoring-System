# Ardunio 
The Arduino platform was used to program and interface all the sensors, including the DS18B20 temperature sensor, LDR, LCD screen, potentiometer, and relay. While the Arduino served as the programming environment, the actual hardware implementation was carried out on the ATmega328P microcontroller, which connected and managed all the sensors and components in the system. 
This setup allowed efficient sensor integration and control within the Greenhouse Monitoring System.
