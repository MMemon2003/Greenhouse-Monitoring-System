# Hardware 
The Greenhouse Monitoring System project  utilized a software tool called Eagle to design schematics and create the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout. 
This software enabled us to map out the connections between components and finalize the design for the system's hardware. The PCB served as the foundation where all sensors, microcontrollers, and other electronic components were soldered. 
Once assembled, the PCB was mounted inside a protective enclosure, with a user interface on the top of the box featuring an LCD screen. 
This screen dynamically displayed real-time measurements of key environmental factors, including soil temperature, humidity, and light levels. The design ensured a compact, organized, and functional system for effective monitoring and control within the greenhouse environment.
