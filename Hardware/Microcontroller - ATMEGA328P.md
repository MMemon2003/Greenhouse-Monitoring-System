# Microcontroller - ATMEGA328P
The ATmega328P microcontroller served as the core hardware for connecting and managing all sensors and components, including the DS18B20 temperature sensor, LDR, LCD screen, potentiometer, and relay. 
While the Arduino platform was used to program these devices, the ATmega328P handled the actual implementation, ensuring seamless integration and operation of the Greenhouse Monitoring System.
