# LDR - Light Sensor
The Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), also known as a Photoresistor, is an analog sensor that measures and detects light intensity.
Its resistance changes based on the amount of sunlight it receives. 
This functionality enables the system to adjust controls dynamically based on light levels, ensuring optimal greenhouse conditions.
