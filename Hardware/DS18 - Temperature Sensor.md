# DS18 - Temperature Sensor 
The temperature sensor measures the degree of hotness or coolness by relying on the voltage across a diode. In our Greenhouse Monitoring System, this contact-based sensor is inserted into the soil to monitor its temperature. The system uses this data to adjust settings and ensure optimal cooling for the selected region.
