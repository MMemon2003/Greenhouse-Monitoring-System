# DHT22 - Humidity Sensor
The DHT22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor measures air temperature and moisture content to provide accurate atmospheric readings. 
This data enables precise adjustments to greenhouse controls.
The sensor converts humidity data—such as relative, absolute, and specific humidity—into electrical signals for processing.
